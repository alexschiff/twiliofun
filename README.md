This was connected to a series of Twilio apps I made using a service called Webscript in Lua. Most of that code isn't public (since it was hosted on Webscript and I cancelled my subscription), but they:

1) Texted my friend Dan on repeat every minute for about 2 hours pretending to be a lady from his past<br>
2) Texted my friend Dave every Saturday at approximately 6:30pm, "Hellllll yeah" for about 3 months without him knowing the culprit<br>
3) Texted me every morning, "What's on your mind?" and posted the response on Twitter with "#dailythoughtjournal" appended

I was later informed that the first two apps were apparently not condoned by Twilio's Terms of Service...oops.
